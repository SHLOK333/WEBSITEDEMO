# Dark Pattern Classifier

## Overview

Welcome to the Dark Pattern Classifier project! This repository contains the code and resources for a classifier designed to identify and analyze dark patterns on websites.

### What are Dark Patterns?

Dark patterns are deceptive and manipulative user interface design practices that trick users into taking actions they might not otherwise perform. This project aims to detect and classify such patterns to raise awareness and promote user-friendly design.

## Getting Started

To use the Dark Pattern Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkateeshh/Dark-Pattern-Claasifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Dark-Pattern-Claasifier
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main functionality of the project is implemented in `app.py`. Run the application with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the main application code.
- `geminiai.py`: Implementation of a specific dark pattern analysis module.
- `google_api_key.py`: Store your Google API key here (if needed).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `DarkPatternLLM/`: Additional resources or modules related to the Dark Pattern Classifier.
